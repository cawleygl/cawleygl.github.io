      <h3><a href="https://www.nespresso.com/" target="_blank">Nespresso.com</a></h3>
      <p>Nespresso.com is a good example of CRAP principles on the web. The site lists nespresso coffee makers and other
        items primarily using horizontal sections to separate design elements. The site uses black and white to
        establish good contrast, and uses different shades of brown to resemble the coffee that they are selling.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>White text on black backgrounds, black text on white backgrounds, and white text
          on darker brown backgrounds create good contrast so that the text is readable. Background photographs that
          differ in color create contrast with one another to differentiate between sections of the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Subsections use the same text size and font to note that they are of equal
          importance. Some sections use a series of buttons that repeat the same style to show that they are options to
          select between.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The footer is right-justified, which is unusual but lines up well on the right
          side. Sections generally use block layout to align large photos across the page, and groups of smaller photos
          are aligned perfectly on the left and right sides. </li>
        <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Sections containing selectable groups of options are closely aligned to show
          that they are members of a group, and larger sections have ample padding to show that sections differ from one
          another.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Art.Yale.edu</a></h3>
      <p>Art.Yale.edu is a poor example of CRAP principles on the web. It is awkwardly organized, brightly colored, and
        overall difficult to look at. All of the content on the page is pushed to the left side, some content moves in a
        distracting manner, among plenty of other infractions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Some elements have enough contrast to be readable, but far too many elements use
          colors too bright to be read comfortably. The design of header elements is reused to hold other content, when
          these should contrast to note the difference in content. Contrast is also used in situations where it
          shouldn't, as nearby elements that fulfill similar purposes use different colors and designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Some repetition, though sporadic, does work to add a little bit of uniformity,
          but this use isn't nearly consistent enough to unify the page. Wildly varying designs come and go at whim,
          many are used only once, and repetition has little to do with the similarities of element content. </li>
        <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Though elements in the main timeline are generally aligned on the left and
          right, some are misaligned, and internal alignment of these elements is inconsistent at best. All of the page
          content is completely left-justified, which wastes a lot of space in larger formats. Smaller elements like
          buttons are inconsistently aligned.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The timeline format does practice good proximity, with post content located
          close together and additional space separating different posts. However, some other related elements are
          located on opposite ends of the page.</li>
      </ul>
