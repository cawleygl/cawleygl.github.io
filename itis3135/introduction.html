        <strong>Background in this Subject: </strong>I got my start in coding
        through a Web Development bootcamp in 2020-2021, where I learned HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript. Since then I've focused more on React with
        Javascript, which is what I used in my first tech position, so I might
        be rusty with the basics but I have experience!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>MacOS. All of my
        development experience is on a Mac, though I'm more used to Windows as
        a user.

        <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </strong>I love to

        <strong>I'd also like to Share: </strong>At home I use a PC keyboard
