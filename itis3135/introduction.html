        <strong>Personal Background: </strong>Grew up in St. Louis, MO and
        Melbourne, FL, most recently lived in St. Louis and Raleigh, NC before
        moving to Charlotte in 2022.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Professional Background: </strong>Most recently worked as a
        Web Developer for HopDrive, a tech startup, and Capgemini, a large
        consulting company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Academic Background: </strong>I graduated with a B.S. in
        Psychology and Spanish from Saint Louis University in 2018.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Background in this Subject: </strong>I got my start in coding
        through a Web Development bootcamp in 2020-2021, where I learned HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript. Since then I've focused more on React with
        Javascript, which is what I used in my first tech position, so I might
        be rusty with the basics but I have experience!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>MacOS. All of my
        development experience is on a Mac, though I'm more used to Windows as
        a user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ITIS3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: </strong>I really enjoy web development and
            want to fill any gaps in my
            knowledge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ITCS3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented
              Systems: </strong>I've enjoyed using Java and learning Object-Oriented design and
            want to work more with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ITIS3310 - Software Architecture & Design: </strong>I want
            to learn more about building applications from start to finish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ITSC2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems: </strong>I'm
            hoping to learn about how computers work at their most basic
            level.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </strong>I love to
        cook, I'm not trained or even that great at it but I love meal
        prepping and making food myself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I'd also like to Share: </strong>At home I use a PC keyboard
        with my Macbook, which makes remembering the keys even more confusing.
      </li>
