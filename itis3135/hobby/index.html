            <p>American football is one of the most popular and influential sports in the United States, at both the
                professional and collegiate levels. In American Football, two teams of 11 players each take the field to
                try and move the ball to the other end of the field, known as their opponent's end zone. The highest
                league of professional football is known as the National Football League (NFL), and this league has
                become so popular and influential that it (among other sports) has created a spin-off game called
                Fantasy Football.</p>
            <p>In Fantasy Football, spectators gather to “draft” professional football players to
                their fantasy football teams. Then, as the players play for their respective professional teams, a
                predetermined algorithm interprets the play of each player into a number of Fantasy points. Since NFL
                matchups are scheduled once per week, Fantasy teams are matched up against one another, with the team
                accumulating the most points that week taking home the victory for their fantasy team. Some fantasy
                football leagues require an entry fee that is paid out to the winningest teams at season's end.

            <h3>Who Should Play Fantasy Football?</h3>
            <p>The answer? Anyone and everyone! Knowledge of the game of football is secondary in Fantasy Football, and
                is not necessary to get started and have fun. Starting off with knowledge helps, but you can easily get
                the basics down in no time. Learning from your mistakes is part of the fun, and playing in a league with
                fellow beginners is a great way to start some friendly, low-stakes competition with friends or
                acquaintances. Leagues can even recommend and make decisions for you, so deferring decisions to the
                computer can give you a starting point if you're stuck in a jam without guidance or knowledge.</p>
            <h3>Who Should I Draft? Who Should I Start?</h3>
            <p>Draft the best available player! Most leagues will rank players in order from best to worst as the draft
                goes on. If you're totally lost, taking the best ranked player available is never a bad call. Overall,
                you want players who can fill each position, and players with different bye weeks. NFL teams don't play
                every single week of the season, every so often taking a “bye,” or a week off. If too many of your
                players share a bye week, you may end up without enough players to fill your roster that week. As the
                season gets going, play the players who aren't injured. This may seem obvious, but with the physical
                nature of American football, managing injuries is an important factor if you want to be successful. Make
                sure you have bench players at the ready, and are checking injury reports if one of your better players
                is injured.</p>

            <p>The best time to get started is before the football season begins in September. However, some leagues
                allow you to get started during the season, so don't worry if you've missed the deadline!</p>

            <p>If I haven't already made the case for playing Fantasy Football, I'll reiterate. Why play? It's fun! Even
                if you don't pick up any knowledge on the game or its players, it's a bonding experience for all
                involved. Play with friends, family, coworkers, or whoever you want to, and take it as seriously (or
                un-seriously) as you want to. Pick players with cool names, or because their projected Defense-Adjusted
                Value over Average this season is going to be off the charts. It's just a game about another game!</p>

            <p>First and foremost, you should play responsibly if you're putting money down.</p>
            <p>On another note, if you're still confused about the rules of American football, and you really think
                you need to know the absolute basics to get your bearings, don't fret. Here's some really basic stuff so
                that watching games on TV isn't an absolute nightmare.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ball starts at the line of scrimmage. That's where most of the players line up.</li>
                <li>The player on the offensive team who gets the ball first is called the Quarterback.</li>
                <li>The Quarterback can choose to throw the ball to a player past the line of scrimmage, but once they
                    do so, no other player can pass the ball forwards again for that play.</li>
                <li>The player that catches the ball downfield is (usually) called the Wide Receiver.</li>
                <li>The Quarterback can run the ball past the line of scrimmage, or give the ball up to another player
                    to run it. This player is (usually) called the Running Back.</li>
                <li>The offensive team has 4 chances to move the ball a total of 10 yards. 10 yards is demarcated on
                    television with a yellow line, and in real-life with a big orange pole (someone should be holding
                    it).</li>
                <li>These chances are referred to as “downs,” and moving the ball past the 10-yard marker is called a
                    “first down.”</li>
