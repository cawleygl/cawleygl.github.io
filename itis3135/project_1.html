    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>This project website will be an interactive product backlog for Mary Dare Martin's Stuff Made by MD storefront. Stuff Made By MD is an online store that sells a variety of handmade gifts through Etsy, consistently adding new items and rotating out old ones. This website will primarily consist of interactive product pages, where all inventory items can be searched and selected individually. Items that are currently for sale will include their sale price and a link to purchase, while unavailable items will display the item's status (seasonal, out of stock, or discontinued) to explain why they are currently not available for purchase. Shoppers of Stuff Made By MD are the intended users of this site, and here they will be able to confirm the status of items that may have appeared on the store in the past, browse to find new products that they might be interested in, and leave reviews of products that will remain even after items must be removed from the store.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
    <p>Many of the pages in this website will include interactive elements using Javascript. The search function on the search page will use Javascript to select and display a list of items that contain the entered keyword in its name or description. The product pages will use Javascript to dynamically load information about an item, while maintaining an identical page design and structure. Online retail sites, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>, and many others use this format in their online shopping sites. The gallery functionality on the featured items page will use Javascript to cycle through a set of featured items, and will use Javascript to periodically select which items are designated as featured. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> is a good example of a site that uses a full-screen gallery preview when viewing options.</p>
